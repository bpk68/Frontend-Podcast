## In this Episode

In episode eight I'm joined by [Emma Bostian](https://twitter.com/emmabostian), a prominent software engineer in the tech Twitter community who works at Spotify. Emma talks to us about the technical interview: the good, the bad, where it can be improved and how it can be useful in hiring the best developers. We also talk about increasing diversity in tech roles and how Emma got into software engineering.
